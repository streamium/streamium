A module for [bitcore][bitcore] that implements [Payment Channels][channel]. Payment channels (sometimes referred as micropayment channels) are a type of smart contracts that allow rapidly adjusting bitcoin transactions. This can be used to do trustless simultaneous payments with a service provider without the need of an intermediary, and some other applications.

See [the main bitcore repo][bitcore] or the [bitcore guide on Payment Channels](http://bitcore.io/guide/channel.html) for more information.
