            To broadcast on Streamium, you first need a Bitcoin Wallet to receive the funds. 
            To set this up, we recommend you to use services like
            <a href="https://blockchain.info/wallet/new">blockchain.info</a>, 
            <a href="https://coinbase.com/signup">Coinbase</a> or
            <a href="https://bitgo.com/signup">BitGo</a>
            which are really fast and simple to use.

            <p>
            Once you created your Wallet, you need to provide us with your Bitcoin Address tied to your Bitcoin Wallet. The Address is a unique identifier which allows you to receive bitcoin on your Bitcoin Wallet. The Bitcoin Address is like your email address, and the Bitcoin Wallet the inbox where you receive the emails sent to that address.
            <p>
            The Bitcoin Address should look something like <em>19ka2SNvry4rocpj1QbJCvwM1vMzBAdqm8</em>.
